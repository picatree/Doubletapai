# DoubletapAi
Using Machine Learning and Javascipt to create an app that tracks a player's performance using webcam. A player dribbles two balls in each hand with sticks called barlets. The app is supposed to automatically count the dribbles or taps on the balls called Doubletaps. Additionally the app is supposed to detect a trick and keep counts both doubletaps and tricks. This app is developed By Frank Kigozi based on the game Doubletap also by Frank Kigozi https://famlyfungames.ca/doubletaps.
Prerequests ML5 and P5js https://editor.p5js.org/picatree/sketches/UF2KC4NUB
Trying adding sliders for barletWidth = 1.5; // in inches, ballDiameter = 9.5; // in inches, doubletapThreshold = 5; // in pixels
Although I provided all libraries in the libraries folder, these libraries are only necessary to run the code as of the time of uploading this file April/25/23. The code might work or break depending on the latest linked libraries in the index.html file. 
Feel free to contribute.
